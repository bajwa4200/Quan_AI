AI Assistant Chatbot with Quantum Computing
Overview
This project integrates a GPT-3.5-based chatbot with quantum computing capabilities. Using Gradio for the user interface, the chatbot provides responses based on GPT-3.5-turbo and enhances them with quantum computation results from IBM’s quantum backend.

Features
GPT-3.5 Chatbot: Provides intelligent responses to user queries using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo.
Quantum Computation: Executes a simple quantum circuit on IBM’s quantum hardware and returns the quantum state probabilities.
Gradio Interface: User-friendly web interface for interacting with the chatbot.
Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

Python 3.x
Gradio
Qiskit
Qiskit IBM Runtime

#Installation:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-chatbot.git
cd quantum-chatbot

Install the required Python packages:

You can create a virtual environment and install the dependencies using pip:

"python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt"

Make sure to have the following packages in your requirements.txt:

gradio
qiskit
qiskit_ibm_runtime
g4f

#Configuration
Set up Qiskit Runtime Service:

You need to provide your IBM Quantum API token in the script. Replace the placeholder token in the script with your actual token:

token="YOUR_IBMQ_TOKEN_HERE"
You can get your token from the IBM Quantum Experience.

Update the backend name:

Ensure that the backend name in the script matches the backend you intend to use. In this case, ibm_brisbane is used.

Usage
Run the application:
 "python app.py"

This command starts the Gradio interface.

Interact with the chatbot:

Open your web browser and go to the local server URL provided by Gradio (typically http://localhost:7860). Type your questions in the text box, and receive responses from the GPT-3.5 chatbot along with quantum computation results.

Example
User Input: What is the current state of quantum computation?
Response:
[GPT-3.5 response to the user query]
Quantum Result: [Quantum computation result]
